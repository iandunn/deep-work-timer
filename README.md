# Deep Work Timer

An intentionally minimal, unintrusive, and low-effort timer to help me focus on [deep work](https://www.fastcompany.com/90368975/what-is-deep-work-and-how-do-you-achieve-it) & [flow state](https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20190204-how-to-find-your-flow-state-to-be-peak-creative) for long periods of time, without interruptions.

It's a simple web page, so [you can use it right now](https://iandunn.github.io/deep-work-timer/).


## How it Works

Instructions are in the timer itself, so that they're easy to access while using it. [Open the timer](https://iandunn.github.io/deep-work-timer/) to read them.

## Why it Works That Way

* **No Interruptions:** Other timers I've used would interrupt me once an arbitrary time limit was reached, which is frustrating when I'm in the middle of a thought, or [mentally juggling a complex problem](https://heeris.id.au/2013/this-is-why-you-shouldnt-interrupt-a-programmer/), or just aren't ready to take a break yet.

* **Control:** Similarly, I don't want my timer to automatically switch back and forth between different modes of work and/or breaks; I want to intentionally & organically choose to switch when I reach a milestone, or just feel like I need something new.

    Tracking the elapsed time isn't even strictly necessary, the core "feature" is just having an external & tangible way to _choose_ to be in deep work, and encouragement to stay there. Tracking the time helps encourage a _minimum_ amount of deep work, especially when I'm tempted to self-interrupt to go check Slack. I don't want to enforce a _maximum_, though.

* **Low-overhead:** I don't want using this to feel like extra work. I don't even want to bother tracking breaks, since that's easy enough to do organically. I just want the bare minimum necessary to help me stay intentional about how I'm spending my time.

* **Not an app:** I don't want to use anything on my phone, because then I'd have to see all the notifications that come in while I'm trying to work.
